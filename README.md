## Question 1

Create an array of strings called `colors` that contain "orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", and "lavender".

Then, using array subscripting and string interpolation, print out the String `"orange, yellow, and lavender are some of my favorite colors"`.
```
var colors = ["orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", "Lavender"]

print("\(colors[0]) , \(colors[2]) and \(colors[4]) are some of my favorite colors")
```

## Question 2

Remove "Illinois" and "Kansas" from the array below.

`var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]`
```
var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]
westernStates.remove(at:5)
westernStates.remove(at:4)
print(westernStates)
```

## Question 3

Iterate through the array below. For each state, print out the name of the state, a colon, and whether it is or is not **in the continental United States.**

`let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]`
```
var moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]
var outside = "Hawaii"
var emptyArr = [""]
var currentIndex = 0
var anotherIndex = 0

for i in moreStates{
if i == outside{
//    print(i)
break
}
currentIndex += 1
}
for i in moreStates{
if i != outside{
moreStates[anotherIndex].append(": it is in the continental United States")
}
else{
moreStates[currentIndex].append(": it is not in continental USA")
}
anotherIndex += 1
}
print(moreStates)
```

## Question 4

Print out how many non-whitespace characters are in `myString`:

`let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"`

```
var spaceCounter = 0
var emptySpace = " "

let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"
for char in myString{
if String(char) != emptySpace{
spaceCounter += 1
}
}
print("There are this many non-whitespace characters \(spaceCounter)")
```

Iterate through the array below. For each sentence, print out how many non-whitespace characters are in it.

`let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]`

```
for char in myFavoriteQuotes{
for i in myFavoriteQuotes[indexCounter]{
if String(i) != emptySpace{
//spaceCounter += 1
}
//print(i, terminator: "")
spaceCounter += 1
}
indexCounter += 1
}
print("There are this many non-whitespace characters \(spaceCounter)")
```

## Question 5

Iterate through `garden` and place any ðŸŒ· that you find into the `basket`. Replace any ðŸŒ· that you pick up with `"dirt"`. Then print how many ðŸŒ· are in your `basket`.

```swift
var garden = ["dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt"]
var basket = [String]()
```
```
var flower = "ðŸŒ·"
var dirty = "dirt"
var counter = 0
var newGarden = ""

var garden = ["dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt"]
var basket = [String]()

for plant in garden{
if plant == flower{
basket.append(flower)
}
}
for _ in garden{
newGarden.append(garden[counter].replacingOccurrences(of: "ðŸŒ·", with: " dirt "))
counter += 1
}
print("\(basket) there are \(basket.count) flowers")
print(newGarden.components(separatedBy: " "))
```

## Question 6

The below array represents an unfinished batting lineup for a baseball team. **You, the coach,** need to make some last minute changes:

- Add "Suzuki" to the end of your lineup.
- Change "Jeter" to "Tejada".
- Change "Thomas" for "Guerrero"
- Put "Reyes" to bat 8th instead.

`var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]`
```
var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]

var arrCount = 0

battingLineup.append("Suzuki")
for i in battingLineup{
if i == "Jeter"{
battingLineup[arrCount] = "Tejada"
}
else if i == "Thomas" {
battingLineup[arrCount] = "Guerrero"
}
else if i == "Reyes"{
battingLineup.swapAt(7, arrCount)
}
arrCount += 1
}
print("\(battingLineup) This is the batting lineup")
```

## Question 7

Given an array of Ints, find out if it contains a target number.  

(The built-in `contains(_:)` function will do this, but you aren't allowed to use it for this exercise.)


```swift
var numbers: [Int]

let target: Int = 32
```

Ex.1

```swift
numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]

target = 32

//true
```

Ex. 2

```swift
numbers = [32459,2,4,5,1,4,2,1]

target = 3

//false
```

```
var numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]
let target: Int = 32
var count = 0

for i in numbers{
if i == target{
count += 1
}
}
if count > 0{
print("True it contains the target number")
}
else{
print("False it does not contain the target number")
}
```


## Question 8

Find the largest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built-in `max()` method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```
```
var arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

var index = 0
var max = 0

for i in arrayOfNumbers{
//print(i, terminator: " ")
if arrayOfNumbers[index] > max{
max = arrayOfNumbers[index]
}
index += 1
}
print("This is the biggest number: \(max)")
```


## Question 9

Find the smallest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built in min() method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```

```
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

var index = 0
var min = 201

for i in arrayOfNumbers{
print(i, terminator: " ")
if arrayOfNumbers[index] < min{
min = arrayOfNumbers[index]
}
index += 1
}
print("This is the smallest number: \(min)")
```


## Question 10

Iterate through `secondListOfNumbers`, and print out all the odd numbers.

`var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]`
```
var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]

for i in secondListOfNumbers{
if i % 2 != 0 {
print(i)
}
}
```

## Question 11

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`

```
var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]
var sum = thirdListOfNumbers.reduce(0, +)

print(sum)
```

## Question 12

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum of all the even numbers.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`
```
var thirdListOfNumbers = [2,4,3,6,7]
var sum = 0
for i in thirdListOfNumbers{
if i % 2 == 0 {
sum += i
}
}
print(sum)
```

## Question 13

Append every Int that appears in both `listOne` and `listTwo` to the `sharedElements` array. Then print **how many Ints** are shared.

```swift
var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
var sharedElements = [Int]()
```


## Question 14

Write code such that `noDupeList` has all the same Ints as `dupeFriendlyList`, but has no more than one of each Int.

```swift
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []
```
```
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []

for i in dupeFriendlyList{
if !noDupeList.contains(i){
noDupeList.append(i)
}
}
print(noDupeList)
```

## Question 15

Find the second smallest number in an Array of Ints

`let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}`

```
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

var sort = arrayOfNumbers.sorted()
print(sort)
print("This is the second smallest number\(sort[1])")
```

## Question 16

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
```
var sum = 0
for i in 1..<1000{
if i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0{
//print(i)
sum += i
}
}
print("Sum of all numbers below 1000: \(sum)")
```

repeated.append("\(test)")
}
}
print(repeated)
```
